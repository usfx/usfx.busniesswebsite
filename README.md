## Project Brief
Tofi is a free online service that reads or scans barcodes on Books, CD’s, DVD’s, and games to determine their current market value. Users input or scan their “International Standard Book Number” or their “European Article Number” into the system to get a quote on how much the company is willing to purchase the specific item for. It is a buy and sell company so the business is quite cost intensive and making profits can be challenging.
We incur inventory cost- warehouse cost, tangible assets, and poor liquidity (cash) unless the
partner company (TWOO) has an agreement with us to buy all the books we are buying from
customers. To increase profits, we considered various strategies that would help us attract
customers, such as adding a rewards system, referring the website to a friend to get a free
book.
We also considered how our pickup service will negatively affect our cost, so we decided to
partner with UPS. Our partner will pick up the delivery up to 25kg and we will pay a commission.
This is a better option when compared to all the cost we would have incurred [mileage cost,
insurance, transport cost] doing it ourselves. The objective of an online company is to minimize
costs.
